<p dir="ltr">Every December, the Rochester Youth Tech Foundation hosts a programming competition for all Rochester Public School students.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>There are 25 puzzles, given out at midnight EST once per day from December 1st - 25th. </span><strong>Our </strong><span>competition ends on December 31st, so there is some extra time to get as many puzzles done as possible. At midnight on December 31st, the scores will be calculated. </span><strong>Our</strong><span> competition is only based on the number of problems completed (stars acquired), not the speed/score unless there is a tie at the end.</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Rules:</span></h3>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><span>Students may enter this competition as individuals, or as a team, but</span><strong> not both</strong><span>. It is up to the honor of the individual students not to cheat in this regard.&nbsp;</span></p>
